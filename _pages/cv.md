## Research Experience

**Stanford University, Molecular and Cellular Physiology**  
*Postdoctoral Scholar*  
_Sep. 2018 – Present_
- Developed large-scale statistical inference and machine learning of transcriptional noise changes with age, particularly in single-cell RNA sequencing atlases and spatial transcriptomic atlases.
- Designed and built a high-speed super-resolution microscope achieving single vesicle (gold nanoparticle) reaching record performance of 0.2 nm in 100 µs.
- Pioneered new ultrasound multimolecular imaging for deep tissue detection of healthy and diseased cells.
- Conducted bioinformatic analysis of proteomics, CRISPRi screens, and patient RNA seq for oncology collaborators working on novel immunotherapy checkpoints (sialic acid-Siglec) in prostate cancer.

**Marine Biology Laboratory, Physiology Course**  
*Student*  
_June 2018 – July 2018_  
- Intensive crash course on modern microscopy, computational biology, and biological techniques.

**JILA, NIST and the University of Colorado, Boulder**  
*NRC Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Associate*  
_Aug. 2014 – May 2018_  
- Designed, constructed, and demonstrated a next-generation atomic clock, a 3D lattice clock, from project conception to 3 parts in 10^19, a world record, with five incredible colleagues and friends.
- Demonstrated the most accurate atomic clock (2 parts in 10^18), a record held from 2014 to 2018.

**University of California, Berkeley**  
*Graduate Student Researcher and Hertz Fellow*  
_Aug. 2008 – Aug. 2014_  
- Designed and constructed a Bose-Einstein condensate experiment from the ground up with four fantastic colleagues.
- Conceived and implemented new precision tests of universal magnetic properties.
