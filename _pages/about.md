Welcome to my website! I'm Edward, a postdoc developing cutting-edge imaging tools to explore the intricate workings of biological systems. My journey has led me from quantum precision measurements (we briefly held the record for the world's most accurate and precise atomic clocks) to bioinformatics and biological imaging, where I focus on creating ultrasound and optical instruments that enable us to see inside living organisms. My interests span building new ultrasound and optical imaging platforms, computational imaging, and bioinformatics.

Looking ahead, my goal is to revolutionize the imaging of cellular and molecular processes deep inside living animals, particularly in mammals like mice and humans. By advancing these imaging technologies, especially with molecular and super-resolution ultrasound, I hope to unlock new insights into disease mechanisms, aging, and tissue repair, paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries in biology and medicine.
